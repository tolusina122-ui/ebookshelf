This README accompanies the cryptographic key material that was generated for you on the Mastercard Developers portal. It provides details about its purpose, usage, and important considerations regarding the expiry dates. 

The cryptographic material provided with this README includes a PKCS#12 keystore, which may bundle a public/private key pair and/or a certificate, depending on the key type you have obtained. Only the public component was shared with Mastercard during the generation process. The cryptographic material, including any certificates stored within the provided PKCS#12 keystore, has an associated expiry date. 

It is crucial to note that the operational expiry date of this cryptographic material as relevant to Mastercard APIs is displayed within the project dashboard on Mastercard Developer where your key was generated. This expiry date is the authoritative reference you should use for managing the lifecycle of your keys, not the expiry date encoded within the file itself. This approach ensures that you are always aligned with the current Mastercard policies and expiration timelines. 

For additional support and inquiries, please refer to the documentation available on the Mastercard Developers portal or contact our support team. 

Thank you for choosing Mastercard Developers for your integration needs.
